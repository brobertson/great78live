# great78live
A python script that plays archived 78 rpm records as announced on the @great78project Twitter feed.
'Great 78' is a yet another amazing project of Archive.org; it aims to digitize thousands of 78-rpm records as donated by individuals and institutions around the US. At times, it processes a different disk every 2 minutes. This script celebrates the Great 78 Project by grabbing the most recent digized files and playing them in reverse order. At present it requires a linux environment, as it uses 'mpg123' to play the downloaded audio files. 

We are running this as a startup script on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. We intend to play it through Adafruit's ['Stereo Bonnet'](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3346) and put all of this in an an old-timey wooden radio enclosure for it to give the impression of a 40's era home radio.
